# Network Codebase
Contains the codebase developed to implement a room-scale VR SteamVR-based UNET network application in Unity.

This code was developed for my MSc Computer Science thesis, "The effects of height and scale in multi-user room-scale VR". Note that the repository does not contain the full Unity project; unfortunately, licensing issues with certain assets prevent me from publishing the project. The code is all here, however.

Note that we use the HTC Vive as our room-scale VR system. Specifically, we use the Interaction System which comes as part of Valve's SteamVR SDK, which is freely available on the Unity asset store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/steamvr-network-essentials-63969

There is a lot of code here, and not all of it is core. Using the knowledge gained from my development process, I plan to release a condensed and refactored version of core code assets required to create a UNET networking application that integrates with the SteamVR Interaction System. That release will come with a full demo, and will be available free of charge. Keep an eye on this page for updates.

Here follows a short description of the code that is of particular interest.
